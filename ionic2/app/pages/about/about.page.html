  <h1>The Project</h1>
  <div class="flex">
    <p>
      This web app is the result of a JavaScript Course at the Technical University of Munich.<br><br>
      On July 6th of this year, Niantic released the new location-based augmented
      reality title PokemonGo. The game took the world by storm and is now
      installed on 5% of smartphones in the US. In the game, players are using
      their smartphones to locate Pokemon - cute and cuddly virtual creatures that
       after being captured and nurtured turn into fearless fighters in the name
      of your ambition to level up.<br><br>
      In the real world Pokemon appear at random places and only for a short
      period of time. While firing up your PokemonGo app and starting to randomly
      look for a Pokemon that may pop up nearby may be a fun thing to do, we
      thought it could be nice if we do not leave things to random chance.
      Instead, we are intelligently guessing when and where our Pokemon will pop
      up.
