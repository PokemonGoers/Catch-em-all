  <ion-title>About this Project</ion-title>
  <p>
    This web app is the result of a JavaScript Course at the Technical University of Munich.<br><br>
    On July 6th of this year, Niantic released the new location-based augmented reality title Pokemon Go.
    The game took the world by storm and is now installed on 5% of smartphones in the US.
    In the game, players are using their smartphones to locate Pokemons - cute and cuddly virtual creatures that after
    being captured and nurtured turn into fearless fighters in the name of your ambition to level up.
    Locating and capturing Pokemons have quickly become a phenomenon - hoards of people have been sighted in
    New York as they chase imaginary creatures and try to capture them in Central Park. Pokemons appear on
    certain places in the real world and wait at those coordinates for a period of time. While firing up
    your Pokemon Go app and starting to randomly looking for Pokemons that may pop up nearby may be a fun
    thing to do, we thought it could be nicer if we do not leave things for random chance, but instead try to
    intelligently guess when and where our Pokemons will pop up.
